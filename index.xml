      <description>I like this place more than Fogo De Chao. Granted, I have not been to the NY location as of this writing. I&amp;rsquo;ve been to the LA location twice. The seasoning at this location to me was better. The salad bar was a let down comparably though. It&amp;rsquo;s small, and they have sushi there which I thought was odd. I still think M-Grill is the best as far as seasoning and char.</description>

      <description>This place&amp;rsquo;s beef noodles was just OK. I&amp;rsquo;ve had better. The portion size is just ok. I also got a side of bean curd, and it was a little on the salty side.</description>

      <description>This place is CASH ONLY as well. Food was pretty good, and it seems like a nice date spot.</description>

      <description>Fried chicken was pretty mediocre. It was dry, and the rub wasn&amp;rsquo;t good. It was overcooked, salty, and not as good as say&amp;hellip; Popeyes.</description>

      <description>The food was surprisingly good, and it&amp;rsquo;s not pricey at all. They give you free sides of rice and beans, so no worries about ordering that.</description>

      <description>The lomo saltado was ok. The sauces cost 60 cents extra.</description>

      <description>This place was really good for Thai food. Would love to come back again for their Tom Yum noodle soup and their soft shell crab special. Price was not expensive at all either.</description>

      <description>This was in a small mall, and it was pretty good. We got the eclairs and apple flan.</description>

      <description>This place is CASH ONLY. The chocolate fondu was good, but the cheese that we got was just ok. The meat quality was pretty good with the wine broth.</description>

      <description>Good XLB. Was flavorful, BUT the price is pretty expensive for what you get. The dessert XLB filled with nutella/banana was gimmicky but tasted good.</description>

      <description>The pho was ok, and so was the dried vermicelli. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit expensive for what you get, but also not bad. I probably would still prefer to go to other Vietnamese places, though good Vietnamese places are hard to find in Manhattan. The decor is nice, but food wise - if anyone likes this place, I don&amp;rsquo;t trust their palette.</description>

      <description>Food was bland, but the steak was surprisingly good for a touristy spot. There are a lot of scares from the ninja waiters. The sushi itself was also pretty bland and mediocre.</description>

      <description>This place was surprisingly good. The pork belly was really tasty with the fried skin and chicharron on top. The beef rib is a must get. Pork ribs are a pass. The ambience is similar to the noir feel.</description>

      <description>These are super tiny one bite mini cupcakes. Pretty good though the flavor profiles aren&amp;rsquo;t that different from each other.</description>

      <description>Got eggs in hell, and it was a nice alternative to shakshookas. Somewhat spicy. The price wasn&amp;rsquo;t too expensive.</description>

      <description>Known for their XLBs, it was pretty darn tasty. They also have stinky tofu too and it&amp;rsquo;s all pretty cheap.</description>

      <description>The food was actually surprisingly good. I would come back here again for Korean. The galbi was pretty tasty and the price wasn&amp;rsquo;t too expensive I think. The meat quality is good.</description>

      <description>Pastrami was ok. It was moist yet tips were dry. Food was cheap though, so might be good for lazy dinners. They have other things.</description>

      <description>The ceviche was good, but the lomo saltado was surprisingly pretty good. Beef slices were tender.</description>

      <description>Decent Japanese snack place with okonomiyaki and octopus balls. But that&amp;rsquo;s about it.</description>

      <description>Was ok. Nothing too memorable. Got the pizza with proscuitto on top. I think they should&amp;rsquo;ve cut it into smaller pieces.</description>

      <description>Pretty bad and expensive. 10 pieces of bites fro $14, and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even come with a drink.</description>

      <description>The feijoada was pretty good. The picanha was interesting in that it was super soft. Not quite what I was expecting.</description>
