      <description>People come here to drink because they&amp;rsquo;re retarded. Terrible drinks. College-ish atmosphere. Pretentious for no reason.
Oh, it has the orange escalator hallway that everyone likes to take pictures of. There&amp;rsquo;s also that purple glass window back that people like too.</description>

      <description>Went here with a friend for the first time. Saw a random bouncer looking guy standing outside of a coffee shop. There&amp;rsquo;s a door next to the coffee shop that leads into an apartment complex. My friend and I looked at each other. We were thinking we were suppose to open this door, and that this &amp;ldquo;speak easy&amp;rdquo; is somewhere in this apartment complex. We tried to open the door, but it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t turn at all.</description>
