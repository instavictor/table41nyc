      <description>Great for the price, although I was here on a pescetarian date. I thought I could do pescetarian, and I can&amp;rsquo;t. Would come back for actual meats.</description>

      <description>Same owner as the Minetta Tavern. Great for the price. I liked teh suckling pork becuase it was straight up fat with crispy skin. Got the whole fish, and it was great too.
Only problem is it is CLOSED.</description>

      <description>This was pretty good and cheap except for the WATER. For tap water, they charged $5.50 wtf?
The steak was pretty good though as well as the sauce.</description>

      <description>Amazing place. The baked alaska and veal tongue were really good. It&amp;rsquo;s also not too expensive.</description>

      <description>Specializes in French style chicken. $100 for a whole chicken. Chicken was soft and juicy with that wild flavor. Pretty expensive for what it is, but it was good.
Probably would be OK with Costco chicken over this.</description>

      <description>They are super stingy with the cheese, and it stinks the instant you walk in. But otherwise, it&amp;rsquo;s delicious. You are allotted 2 cheese shavings. One of the guests at my table did not want their second shaving, so I used their second shaving for a total of three shaving. It&amp;rsquo;s good but not too expensive.</description>

      <description>This place is really good. Their steamed eggs are super fluffy, but pretty expensive. It&amp;rsquo;s crowded but easy to walk in as 1.</description>

      <description>Came here for brunch. Got the duck hash, and it was pretty good. Service was slower than a snail crawling across the sidewalk.</description>
