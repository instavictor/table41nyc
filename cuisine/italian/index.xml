      <description>Had to make reservations 30 days ahead of time. Food was decent. Interior is nice. Homemade pasta. Good date place. Slightly overrated. Very similar to Culver City Bucato (before it shuttered) a few years ago.</description>

      <description>Food was just ok even though it&amp;rsquo;s highly recommended by people. Probably a good date place though.</description>

      <description>Really good. Homemade pasta, and steak was good. Wasn&amp;rsquo;t that expensive either. Has been renamed to Scriptum Brooklyn. Not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s the same place.</description>

      <description>I only ate here because it was close to the MET. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember what I had, but I&amp;rsquo;ve only written that it was good.</description>
