      <description>Pretty decent. Worth this 1 time trip and that&amp;rsquo;s about it. The oyster pan roast was alright. The soft shell crab was pretty decent too. I think I&amp;rsquo;d get the clam chowder over the oyster pan roast.</description>

      <description>This used to be in the Lower East Side, but I guess they set up shop in this Gansevoort Market area. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t that good. I prefer the A Salt &amp;amp; Battery place instead.</description>

      <description>Got the soft shell poboy. Was decent for lunch. $17 for fries, drink, and a poboy. The normal stuff is rather expensive. Probably a $2-3 per pound markup compared to LA.</description>

      <description>This is Marc Forgione&amp;rsquo;s fast food-ish restaurant near Penn Station. I got the chili lobster here, but it&amp;rsquo;s not as good as having it at the restaurant.
It&amp;rsquo;s also CLOSED.</description>

      <description>Good restaurant. I like the spanish octopus, fish churros, and pork chop.
Unfortunately, it&amp;rsquo;s CLOSED.</description>
