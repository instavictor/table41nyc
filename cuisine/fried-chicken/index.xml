      <description>Fried chicken sandwich was ok. Has a kick to it just like every fried chicken sandwich place. Cash only though. Don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;d care to come back.</description>

      <description>A few doors down from the Ssam bar, this place is pretty good. $12 for a combo which was basically drink, fries, and the sandwich. The Momofuku red sauce is always good.
Unfortunately this is CLOSED.</description>

      <description>This was really good and pretty spicy with the right kick. Everything is good here including the Detroit style pizzas.</description>

      <description>This fried chicken sandwich was a special served during lunch and was quite good.
I think Westville&amp;rsquo;s normal menu seems bland and isn&amp;rsquo;t that great.</description>
