      <description>Got eggs in hell, and it was a nice alternative to shakshookas. Somewhat spicy. The price wasn&amp;rsquo;t too expensive.</description>

      <description>Got the Shakshooka. I also asked for hot sauce, and it was some wet guacamole green looking thing. It has a nice kick to it. The shakshooka was also green too instead of the normal red sauce. Has a good kick to it and was also more sour than usual. Also got a side of the duck bacon which was interesting.
Again, skip the lines and sit at the bar.</description>

      <description>So apparently, the head baker from Peter Pans down the street now works here. Regardless, the ECLAIR with the white filling in the middle is really really good. It&amp;rsquo;s not too sweet and CHEAP @ $1.50. Better than DKs. Skip the cake donuts of course.</description>

      <description>This place is cash-only and has Japanese style breakfasts. Think tomato sauce on top of an omelette that has fried rice in it.
I got the hamburger steak of course. Decent. Decor is interesting.</description>

      <description>The Korean looking sammich was good, and so was the biscuits and gravy. Can you tell I&amp;rsquo;m a biscuits and gravy kinda person?
If there&amp;rsquo;s a line outside, check the bar inside. Might be able to walk in and sit there instead of waiting for a table.</description>

      <description>This place is really good. Their steamed eggs are super fluffy, but pretty expensive. It&amp;rsquo;s crowded but easy to walk in as 1.</description>

      <description>This place sucks, is pricey, and is extremely overrated. I don&amp;rsquo;t understand why this place has so many people. $18 for a egg on top of salad with fried chicken.</description>

      <description>Love it! The creme brulee! The cake donuts are whatevers, but the yeast ones are good. I still love Dough more though.</description>

      <description>This place was pretty good, but I feel it&amp;rsquo;s overrated. It has a lot of lox stuff. I didn&amp;rsquo;t care much for it, but then again I don&amp;rsquo;t care about lox either.</description>

      <description>Came here for brunch. Got the duck hash, and it was pretty good. Service was slower than a snail crawling across the sidewalk.</description>
