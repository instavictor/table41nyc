      <description>I like this place more than Fogo De Chao. Granted, I have not been to the NY location as of this writing. I&amp;rsquo;ve been to the LA location twice. The seasoning at this location to me was better. The salad bar was a let down comparably though. It&amp;rsquo;s small, and they have sushi there which I thought was odd. I still think M-Grill is the best as far as seasoning and char.</description>

      <description>The food was surprisingly good, and it&amp;rsquo;s not pricey at all. They give you free sides of rice and beans, so no worries about ordering that.</description>

      <description>The feijoada was pretty good. The picanha was interesting in that it was super soft. Not quite what I was expecting.</description>
