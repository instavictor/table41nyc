      <description>The cream of spinach tastes like Lawry&amp;rsquo;s. The horseradish cream was good. The prime rib not as good as Keen&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>Got the Delmonico steak. I like the char on this, but the steak kindi of sucked because it wasn&amp;rsquo;t flavorful nor fatty. Cream of spinach was just OK.</description>

      <description>Got the rare strip. It was pretty good for $30 for 14 oz. Not a lot of fat on it. I think the price keeps getting cheaper because not a lot of people go to this.</description>

      <description>New York strip was so so. Cream of spinach was not good. There were lots of tendons in the meat. The lava cake dessert was good though.</description>

      <description>This place is overrated. The steak isn&amp;rsquo;t that tender. There are a bunch of copy cat places like Wolfgang that are comparable. In addition, when I went, this place was cash only.</description>

      <description>Got the aged rib eye for 2. Was surprisingly good. It&amp;rsquo;s not the best steakhouse in New York, but it&amp;rsquo;s not bad at all.</description>
