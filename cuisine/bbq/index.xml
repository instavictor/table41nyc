      <description>This place was surprisingly good. The pork belly was really tasty with the fried skin and chicharron on top. The beef rib is a must get. Pork ribs are a pass. The ambience is similar to the noir feel.</description>

      <description>For whatever reason, the brisket was dry even though it&amp;rsquo;s recommended by Yelpers. The pastrami was also dry and overly salty. Generally the BBQ was bad. Maybe it was just this one time, not sure.</description>

      <description>This is butterly delicious. A bit of a trek to get to, but worth it in a party and if you&amp;rsquo;re bored. The bacon&amp;rsquo;s really good.</description>

      <description>Terrible BBQ. Go here for cheap stale dry meats in tourist hell.
Oh apparently it&amp;rsquo;s permanently closed.</description>
