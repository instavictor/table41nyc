      <description>Known for their XLBs, it was pretty darn tasty. They also have stinky tofu too and it&amp;rsquo;s all pretty cheap.</description>

      <description>Pastrami was ok. It was moist yet tips were dry. Food was cheap though, so might be good for lazy dinners. They have other things.</description>

      <description>Decent ramen. Got some super fancy ramen, and it was fat. Not the best though and it&amp;rsquo;s in a not so great neighborhood.</description>

      <description>Michelin 1 star restaurant for Mexican. Place isn&amp;rsquo;t great, but it&amp;rsquo;s not bad. Tacos are WAY too pricey at $6 a piece for such a tiny thing.</description>

      <description>Korean wings. They have ice cream beer which was a gimmick. It&amp;rsquo;s mediocre at best. They do give you these finger &amp;ldquo;condom&amp;rdquo; looking things to handle the chicken.</description>

      <description>For whatever reason, the brisket was dry even though it&amp;rsquo;s recommended by Yelpers. The pastrami was also dry and overly salty. Generally the BBQ was bad. Maybe it was just this one time, not sure.</description>

      <description>Decent vibey bar similar to some LES places, but way out in Queens. But who knows maybe Long Island City might be the next spot after Williamsburg!</description>
