      <description>The food was actually surprisingly good. I would come back here again for Korean. The galbi was pretty tasty and the price wasn&amp;rsquo;t too expensive I think. The meat quality is good.</description>

      <description>Pastrami was ok. It was moist yet tips were dry. Food was cheap though, so might be good for lazy dinners. They have other things.</description>

      <description>The ceviche was good, but the lomo saltado was surprisingly pretty good. Beef slices were tender.</description>

      <description>Was ok. Nothing too memorable. Got the pizza with proscuitto on top. I think they should&amp;rsquo;ve cut it into smaller pieces.</description>

      <description>The feijoada was pretty good. The picanha was interesting in that it was super soft. Not quite what I was expecting.</description>

      <description>This place was really really good. Korean Michelin 2 star and well worth it. Probably one of the best Michelin star restaurants I&amp;rsquo;ve been to in NYC.</description>

      <description>The cream of spinach tastes like Lawry&amp;rsquo;s. The horseradish cream was good. The prime rib not as good as Keen&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>Got the Delmonico steak. I like the char on this, but the steak kindi of sucked because it wasn&amp;rsquo;t flavorful nor fatty. Cream of spinach was just OK.</description>

      <description>Got the rare strip. It was pretty good for $30 for 14 oz. Not a lot of fat on it. I think the price keeps getting cheaper because not a lot of people go to this.</description>

      <description>New York strip was so so. Cream of spinach was not good. There were lots of tendons in the meat. The lava cake dessert was good though.</description>

      <description>This place is overrated. The steak isn&amp;rsquo;t that tender. There are a bunch of copy cat places like Wolfgang that are comparable. In addition, when I went, this place was cash only.</description>

      <description>Got the aged rib eye for 2. Was surprisingly good. It&amp;rsquo;s not the best steakhouse in New York, but it&amp;rsquo;s not bad at all.</description>
