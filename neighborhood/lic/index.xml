      <description>Decent ramen. Got some super fancy ramen, and it was fat. Not the best though and it&amp;rsquo;s in a not so great neighborhood.</description>

      <description>Michelin 1 star restaurant for Mexican. Place isn&amp;rsquo;t great, but it&amp;rsquo;s not bad. Tacos are WAY too pricey at $6 a piece for such a tiny thing.</description>

      <description>Interesting Chipotle/Dos Toros style but feels a little more ghetto? Food was ok but cheap.</description>

      <description>It was ok. Meat was overly chewy and tough. Price wasn&amp;rsquo;t too bad.</description>

      <description>Bagel was pretty bad. The toasted coconut cold brew wasn&amp;rsquo;t that good.</description>

      <description>For whatever reason, the brisket was dry even though it&amp;rsquo;s recommended by Yelpers. The pastrami was also dry and overly salty. Generally the BBQ was bad. Maybe it was just this one time, not sure.</description>

      <description>Decent vibey bar similar to some LES places, but way out in Queens. But who knows maybe Long Island City might be the next spot after Williamsburg!</description>
