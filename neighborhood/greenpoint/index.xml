      <description>The pho was ok, and so was the dried vermicelli. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit expensive for what you get, but also not bad. I probably would still prefer to go to other Vietnamese places, though good Vietnamese places are hard to find in Manhattan. The decor is nice, but food wise - if anyone likes this place, I don&amp;rsquo;t trust their palette.</description>

      <description>Surprisingly good. The oyster shuckers did a good job keeping it juicy. Happy hour is cheap!</description>

      <description>Got the pozole here which seems to be uncommon here in NYC. Spicy, but pretty good.
Too bad it&amp;rsquo;s CLOSED.</description>

      <description>This place was ok in Greenpoint. The soondobu was probably the better thing to get. They do have Korean style tacos.</description>

      <description>So apparently, the head baker from Peter Pans down the street now works here. Regardless, the ECLAIR with the white filling in the middle is really really good. It&amp;rsquo;s not too sweet and CHEAP @ $1.50. Better than DKs. Skip the cake donuts of course.</description>

      <description>Crowded AF. Really noisy, bartenders slow AF. Standard Biergarten is better as well as the other one in Billsburg.</description>

      <description>Cool divey spot. Cheap drinks. Lots of gin/tequila based cocktails. They occasionally have random small bands.</description>
