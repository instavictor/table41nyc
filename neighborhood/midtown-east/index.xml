      <description>Pretty decent. Worth this 1 time trip and that&amp;rsquo;s about it. The oyster pan roast was alright. The soft shell crab was pretty decent too. I think I&amp;rsquo;d get the clam chowder over the oyster pan roast.</description>

      <description>Pretty good tsukemen. Get the spicy miso. Tsukemen seems fairly rare in NYC. Still looking for something similar to LA Tsujita.</description>

      <description>Jazzy loungy restaurant. Might be good for a date spot if you&amp;rsquo;re into dine and jazz, but the food was just OK.</description>
