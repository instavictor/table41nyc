      <description>This place was ok. Pasta was good, but it needs protein. The meat cheese board was just ok.</description>

      <description>Same owner as the Minetta Tavern. Great for the price. I liked teh suckling pork becuase it was straight up fat with crispy skin. Got the whole fish, and it was great too.
Only problem is it is CLOSED.</description>

      <description>This place sucks, is pricey, and is extremely overrated. I don&amp;rsquo;t understand why this place has so many people. $18 for a egg on top of salad with fried chicken.</description>
