      <description>They are known on Instagram for their Burrata pizza which was about $25. It was ok. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t go out of my way to get it because it literally is just a margarita style pizza with a big piece of burrata cheese in the middle. The burrata wasn&amp;rsquo;t that soft when cut for some reason.</description>
