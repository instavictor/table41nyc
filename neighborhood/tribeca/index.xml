      <description>Food was bland, but the steak was surprisingly good for a touristy spot. There are a lot of scares from the ninja waiters. The sushi itself was also pretty bland and mediocre.</description>

      <description>This place was surprisingly good. The pork belly was really tasty with the fried skin and chicharron on top. The beef rib is a must get. Pork ribs are a pass. The ambience is similar to the noir feel.</description>

      <description>This place was really really good. Korean Michelin 2 star and well worth it. Probably one of the best Michelin star restaurants I&amp;rsquo;ve been to in NYC.</description>

      <description>The only standalone Italian beef sandwich in the city. The other is at the Billsburg Smorgasburg and is a mess to eat. This place is pretty good for fast food.</description>
