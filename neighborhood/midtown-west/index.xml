      <description>I like this place more than Fogo De Chao. Granted, I have not been to the NY location as of this writing. I&amp;rsquo;ve been to the LA location twice. The seasoning at this location to me was better. The salad bar was a let down comparably though. It&amp;rsquo;s small, and they have sushi there which I thought was odd. I still think M-Grill is the best as far as seasoning and char.</description>

      <description>The food was surprisingly good, and it&amp;rsquo;s not pricey at all. They give you free sides of rice and beans, so no worries about ordering that.</description>

      <description>This place was really good for Thai food. Would love to come back again for their Tom Yum noodle soup and their soft shell crab special. Price was not expensive at all either.</description>

      <description>The food was actually surprisingly good. I would come back here again for Korean. The galbi was pretty tasty and the price wasn&amp;rsquo;t too expensive I think. The meat quality is good.</description>

      <description>The cream of spinach tastes like Lawry&amp;rsquo;s. The horseradish cream was good. The prime rib not as good as Keen&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>Best prime rib I have ever had. They are known for their mutton chops though, but damn&amp;hellip; this prime rib is that good!</description>

      <description>This is Marc Forgione&amp;rsquo;s fast food-ish restaurant near Penn Station. I got the chili lobster here, but it&amp;rsquo;s not as good as having it at the restaurant.
It&amp;rsquo;s also CLOSED.</description>

      <description>I think this is still one of my top favorite ramen places in NYC. It&amp;rsquo;s cash only.</description>

      <description>It seems I only wrote &amp;ldquo;pretty good&amp;rdquo; on my spreadsheet, and right now I am drawing a blank about this place.</description>

      <description>So bad. The lomo saltado is really dry. Can&amp;rsquo;t seem to find a decent lomo saltado in NYC.</description>

      <description>Decent yakitori skewers, but that&amp;rsquo;s about it. A bit pricey and always a line.</description>
