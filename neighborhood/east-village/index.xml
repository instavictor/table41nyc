      <description>Got the rare strip. It was pretty good for $30 for 14 oz. Not a lot of fat on it. I think the price keeps getting cheaper because not a lot of people go to this.</description>

      <description>Super salty and overrated. The only good Momofoku restaurants is Fuku (the fried chicken joint) and Ko (the michelin star).</description>

      <description>Overrated and pricey. I&amp;rsquo;d skip here any day of the week. Daikokuya in LA is way better.</description>

      <description>Recommended by Totto Ramen server for best thick noodle in NYC. Soup was bad and salty. But yeah the noodle was pretty good.</description>

      <description>Fast food version of Marta&amp;rsquo;s. It&amp;rsquo;s good. I like the salami and hot peppers, and it&amp;rsquo;s fairly inexpensive.</description>

      <description>Was good but nothing particularly struck a note to me. Marc Forgione tasting menu is way better than here.</description>

      <description>This place is pretty cheap. I remember both the lomo and pollo being a bit on the dry side, but it&amp;rsquo;s so cheap not much of a reason to complain I guess.</description>

      <description>Fairly inexpensive, but not very OG. Portions are small, and no where as good as LA shabu shabu.</description>

      <description>This place was such a gimmick. Very showy like Benihanas but way worse. Food was just ok and super pricey. They have bday celebrations&amp;hellip; super weird.
But it&amp;rsquo;s CLOSED.</description>

      <description>A few doors down from the Ssam bar, this place is pretty good. $12 for a combo which was basically drink, fries, and the sandwich. The Momofuku red sauce is always good.
Unfortunately this is CLOSED.</description>

      <description>They are super stingy with the cheese, and it stinks the instant you walk in. But otherwise, it&amp;rsquo;s delicious. You are allotted 2 cheese shavings. One of the guests at my table did not want their second shaving, so I used their second shaving for a total of three shaving. It&amp;rsquo;s good but not too expensive.</description>

      <description>Taiwanese beef noodle was pretty good. $$$ but the broth was good. Long wait, but not sure if it&amp;rsquo;s worth it. I kinda want to make my own again.</description>

      <description>Noodles pretty good, but service sucks big time.
It&amp;rsquo;s probably why this place is PERMA CLOSED.</description>
