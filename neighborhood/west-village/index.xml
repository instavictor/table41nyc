      <description>The feijoada was pretty good. The picanha was interesting in that it was super soft. Not quite what I was expecting.</description>

      <description>This is the old Mew Men place. Pretty good ramen. The spicy is actually spicy, and the broth is super flavorful. The only caveat is there is not a lot of stuff that comes with the soup. Just a few veggies, and that&amp;rsquo;s it. They should have some sort of combo or something.</description>

      <description>For whatever reason, there are 2 locations within neighboring vicinity of each other in the West Village. The ramen is similar to Shinsengumi. Slightly disappointed.</description>

      <description>Great for the price, although I was here on a pescetarian date. I thought I could do pescetarian, and I can&amp;rsquo;t. Would come back for actual meats.</description>

      <description>Interesting desserts and pretty good. In the summer, they have burrata frozen yogurt as well as some type of watermelon frosty thing.
They&amp;rsquo;re also known for the Cronut, but it can be bought at the Spring location.</description>

      <description>Got the Shakshooka. I also asked for hot sauce, and it was some wet guacamole green looking thing. It has a nice kick to it. The shakshooka was also green too instead of the normal red sauce. Has a good kick to it and was also more sour than usual. Also got a side of the duck bacon which was interesting.
Again, skip the lines and sit at the bar.</description>

      <description>This place is really good. Their steamed eggs are super fluffy, but pretty expensive. It&amp;rsquo;s crowded but easy to walk in as 1.</description>
